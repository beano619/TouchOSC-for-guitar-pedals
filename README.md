This is a project I've been playing with for more than a year. Currently set up to work for the following pedals: H90, Chase Bliss Onward,
Hologram Microcosm, Merris LVX, Poly Ample, Kernom Moho, Elektron Analog Drive and Korg NTS-3 kaoss Pad.  Under documents you will see what
midi channel is assigned to what pedal.  There is some wasted space in here as I have yet to officially fine tune it, but works great for 
my setup with an ipad to control all...  I did take some ideas from here and patchstorage to start with my journey... If you see something
developed, let me know so I can give you a high five and let others know your name!
